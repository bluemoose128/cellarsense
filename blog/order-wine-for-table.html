        <h1>How to Order Wine for the Whole Table (With Confidence)</h1>
        
        <p>Someone has to order the wine. The menu lands in front of you, everyone's looking expectantly, and suddenly you're responsible for a decision that affects the whole meal.</p>
        
        <p>No pressure, right?</p>
        
        <p>Here's the good news: ordering wine for a group is easier than it seems once you know a few basics. And the goal isn't perfection. It's picking something good that people will enjoy.</p>

        <h2>Start by Asking (If You Don't Already Know)</h2>
        
        <p>A quick "anyone have strong preferences?" takes five seconds and saves you from ordering a big red when someone at the table only drinks white. If you already know the group well, you can skip this.</p>
        
        <p>Pay attention to what people ordered to eat, too. A table full of steak dinners calls for different wine than a mix of fish and salads.</p>

        <h2>One Bottle or Two?</h2>
        
        <p>If everyone's eating similar food or you know the group shares tastes, one bottle (or two of the same) keeps things simple. But if half the table wants red and half wants white, just get both. Nobody's keeping score, and trying to find one wine that pleases everyone often means finding one that excites no one.</p>

        <h2>Bottles vs. Glasses</h2>
        
        <p>By-the-glass pricing is almost always worse value than bottles. A bottle typically equals about five glasses, so if three or more people are drinking wine, a bottle makes sense financially.</p>
        
        <p>That said, glasses make sense in certain situations: if people want different things, if you're at a wine bar with an exceptional by-the-glass program, or if you simply don't want to commit to a full bottle. Don't overthink it.</p>

        <h2>House Wine Isn't Always Bad</h2>
        
        <p>The "never order house wine" advice is outdated. Many restaurants, especially in cities with competitive dining scenes, actually put thought into their house selections. A solid house wine at a good restaurant can be a better value than a marked-up name brand.</p>
        
        <p>That said, at a chain restaurant or somewhere wine clearly isn't a priority, you might want to step up one level.</p>

        <h2>The Confidence Move</h2>
        
        <p>If you're unsure, just pick something. Seriously. Hesitating and second-guessing yourself makes the whole table uncomfortable. Pick a wine in your budget, from a region you've enjoyed before, and order it like you mean it.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Safe crowd-pleasers:</strong> Pinot Noir (light red, food-friendly), Malbec (medium red, easy drinking), Sauvignon Blanc (crisp white), Chardonnay (richer white)
        </div>

        <h2>It's Okay to Ask for Help</h2>
        
        <p>If the restaurant has a sommelier or a knowledgeable server, use them. Tell them what people are eating and give them a price range (you can point to a wine at your target price and say "something like this"). They want to help you find something good. That's literally their job.</p>

        <h2>The Most Important Thing</h2>
        
        <p>Wine is supposed to enhance the meal, not stress you out. Even if you pick something that's just okay, the food and conversation will carry the evening. Nobody's going to remember that the wine was merely good instead of great.</p>
        
        <p>So take a breath, make a choice, and enjoy dinner.</p>
