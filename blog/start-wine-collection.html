        <h1>How to Start a Wine Collection (Even in a Small Space)</h1>
        
        <p>Starting a wine collection sounds intimidating. Wine cellars. Temperature controls. Thousands of dollars of bottles aging for decades.</p>
        
        <p>That's one way to do it. But there's a simpler way that anyone can start today.</p>

        <h2>You Don't Need a Wine Fridge (Yet)</h2>
        
        <p>The most important factors for storing wine are: temperature stability, darkness, and reasonable humidity. A dedicated wine fridge handles all of these perfectly, but it's not required to start.</p>
        
        <p>Find a dark spot in your home where temperature stays relatively stable: an interior closet, under the stairs, or a cool corner of a basement. Aim for somewhere that stays between 55-65°F year-round without dramatic swings.</p>
        
        <p>That's it. That's your starter cellar.</p>

        <h2>Buy Wine You Actually Want to Drink</h2>
        
        <p>This sounds obvious but gets ignored. Don't buy wine because it's supposed to be a good investment or because someone said it'll be worth more later. Buy wine you're excited to drink.</p>
        
        <p>A collection should bring you joy, both when you look at it and when you open a bottle.</p>

        <h2>The Three-Bottle Experiment</h2>
        
        <p>Want to understand how wine evolves? Here's a simple approach: when you find a wine you love that has aging potential, buy three bottles of the same wine.</p>
        
        <p>Drink one now. Drink one in a year. Drink one in three to five years. You'll learn firsthand how that particular wine develops over time. It's more educational than any book.</p>

        <h2>What Wines Age Well?</h2>
        
        <p>Most wines are ready to drink when you buy them. The winery has already aged them. Keeping a typical $15 bottle for five years won't make it better. It might make it worse.</p>
        
        <p>Wines that benefit from additional aging typically have high acidity, high tannins, or both. This usually means certain red wines, though some whites (like quality Riesling or white Burgundy) age beautifully too.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Wines with aging potential:</strong><br>
            Cabernet Sauvignon (quality producers), Barolo and Barbaresco, Bordeaux, Brunello di Montalcino, age-worthy Pinot Noir (Burgundy, Oregon), vintage Champagne, and quality Riesling
        </div>

        <h2>It's Okay to Drink Your Collection</h2>
        
        <p>Some collectors treat wine like museum pieces, waiting for the perfect moment that never comes. Wine is for drinking. If you never open the bottles, what's the point?</p>
        
        <p>It's better to open a bottle slightly early than to wait until it's past its peak. Most people err on the side of waiting too long, not drinking too soon.</p>

        <h2>Avoid the Auction Trap (For Now)</h2>
        
        <p>Wine auctions can be great places to find rare bottles, but they're tricky for beginners. Provenance (how the wine was stored before you) is uncertain, and it's easy to overpay without experience.</p>
        
        <p>Start by buying from reputable retailers. Once you've learned more about what you like and what wines are worth, auctions can become a useful resource.</p>

        <h2>Just Start</h2>
        
        <p>The best wine collection is one you actually build. Don't wait until you have the perfect storage setup or the right budget. Start with a few bottles you're excited about, stored in the best spot you have available.</p>
        
        <p>Buy wine. Drink wine. Learn what you like. That's all collecting really is.</p>
